title: Addressing Color Blindness Accessibility
description: >
    This use case revolves around addressing the accessibility issue related to
    color blindness among our employees. It involves evaluating the current
    color coding system, identifying alternatives that are more inclusive, and
    implementing solutions to ensure all employees can effectively interpret and
    interact with the system's visual cues.

## Problem

Following the recent launch of our redesigned system, celebrations ensued, marking a milestone in our efforts to enhance user experience. However, a post-launch survey revealed an unforeseen issue – the color coding system poses challenges for employees with color blindness. This revelation underscores the critical importance of accessibility considerations in our digital products and prompts immediate action to rectify this oversight.

## Proposal

This proposal suggests integrating textures into the design of our system's banners to enhance accessibility. Textures offer a tactile element that can be perceived through touch or visually, providing an additional means of conveying information beyond color alone. By strategically incorporating textures into our banners, we can ensure that essential messages and visual cues are accessible to all users, regardless of their color vision abilities.&nbsp;

## The current experience

Our kitchen display system shows our line cook what to do and when to do it. The cards are color coded depending on it's status. Gray for New orders, Orange for Getting late and red for late and cancelled orders.​​​![](/uploads/kitchen-queueing.png)​

We run some simulation on our design to know what each user sees depending on the type of their color blindedness.

## Research

I've done some readings, how other system promote inclusivity in terms of there status. I found a very interesting study done by Trello which relates very much to me. ​​​​​​

## Expected Outcomes:

1. Improved Accessibility: The integration of textures into banners will enhance accessibility by providing an alternative visual cue that can be perceived by users with color vision deficiencies.
2. Enhanced User Experience: By prioritizing accessibility, we aim to create a more inclusive and user-friendly experience for all individuals interacting with our system.
3. Compliance with Accessibility Standards: Ensure compliance with accessibility standards such as WCAG, demonstrating our commitment to providing equitable access to digital resources.

## Conclusion:

The inclusion of textures in our banners represents a proactive step towards improving accessibility and ensuring that our system is accessible to all users, regardless of their color vision abilities. By prioritizing inclusivity in our design and development processes, we can create a more accessible and equitable digital environment for all individuals.
