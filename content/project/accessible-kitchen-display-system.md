title: 'Addressing Color Blindness Accessibility: Use Case Analysis'
description: >
    This use case revolves around addressing the accessibility issue related to
    color blindness among our employees. It involves evaluating the current
    color coding system, identifying alternatives that are more inclusive, and
    implementing solutions to ensure all employees can effectively interpret and
    interact with the system's visual cues.

## Problem

Following the recent launch of our redesigned system, celebrations ensued, marking a milestone in our efforts to enhance user experience. However, a post-launch survey revealed an unforeseen issue – the color coding system poses challenges for employees with color blindness. This revelation underscores the critical importance of accessibility considerations in our digital products and prompts immediate action to rectify this oversight.

## Proposal

This proposal suggests integrating textures into the design of our system's banners to enhance accessibility. Textures offer a tactile element that can be perceived through touch or visually, providing an additional means of conveying information beyond color alone. By strategically incorporating textures into our banners, we can ensure that essential messages and visual cues are accessible to all users, regardless of their color vision abilities.&nbsp;

## The current experience

Our kitchen display system shows our line cook what to do and when to do it. The cards are color coded depending on it's status. Gray for New orders, Orange for Getting late and red for late and cancelled orders.

We run some simulation on our design to know what each user sees depending on the type of their color blindedness.
