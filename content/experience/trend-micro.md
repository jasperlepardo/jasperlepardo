summary:
    - As one of the leading anti-virus company, serving 30% of the enterprise market worldwide, giving the best customer support is key to the their success.
    - In my almost 2 years stint, I was a key person tasked in modernizing its legacy Enterprise Support Portal into a more user-friendly and mobile-responsive web application. Our goal is to give our customers an intuitive way of accessing Trend Micro's support services by enabling them to quickly file for a support ticket through the portal. We've streamlined other business processes by integrating them into the portal and automated other routinic task. This enables faster case resolutions which freed up valuable man-hours that can be refocused to a more impactful task.
    - During it's development, I noticed a gap between the design team and the development team. To solve this, I've translated the company's design guidelines into a web-based living design system. This established a common language for both teams and enables the designers to design/prototype directly into the web. It also ensured that the design specifications will be strictly followed without the need to create a separate design documents, which ultimately cuts the designer-developer handoff time into half.
